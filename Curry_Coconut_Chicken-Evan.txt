Green Coconut Chicken
While there is a nice dose of red curry powder in the braise, it's 
certainly not the dominant flavor. For something that might seem exotic 
and boldly-spiced, this a surprisingly mellow dish.

DirectionsInstructions Checklist
Step 1
Season chicken legs with salt on all sides.

Step 2
Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in skillet over medium heat; place chicken 
legs in the pan and cook until golden brown on each side, about 4 minutes 
per side. Remove chicken from skillet and set aside.

Step 3
Place coconut milk, water, garlic, jalapeno peppers, cilantro, and green 
onion into a blender. Cover and puree until smooth. Set aside.

Step 4
Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. 
Stir in sliced onion and ginger; cook until sizzling, 1 to 2 minutes.

Step 5
Sprinkle red curry powder over onions and ginger; cook, stirring 
constantly, until fragrant and lightly toasted, about 1 minute.

Step 6
Place chicken legs in a single layer on top of onions and ginger. Pour 
pureed coconut mixture, lime juice, fish sauce, and brown sugar over the 
chicken.

Step 7
Bring mixture to a boil and reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer, skimming 
off any fat, until chicken legs are tender, about 45 minutes. Remove 
chicken from the Dutch oven.
Step 8
Stir potatoes into coconut milk mixture, increase heat to medium-high and 
bring to a boil. Stir in eggplant; cook until potatoes and eggplant are 
tender, about 20 minutes.

Step 9
Stir basil into coconut milk mixture; season with salt and pepper to 
taste.

Step 10
Return chicken to coconut milk mixture; reduce heat to medium-low and 
simmer until chicken is heated through, about 5 minutes.
