LOTUS ROOT STIR-FRY: INSTRUCTIONS
Prep the lotus root by peeling them, trimming the ends, and thinly slicing them, until you have about 12 ounces (340g). Really make an effort to get thin slices! A mandolin is a handy tool to use for this if you have one. If not, simply use a sharp knife to carefully cut the lotus root into thin slices.

Bring a large wok or pot of water to a boil and blanch the lotus root, wood ears, and bell peppers for 45 seconds. Drain thoroughly and set aside.

Combine the chicken stock, oyster sauce, salt, sugar, and white pepper in a small bowl to create the sauce mixture and set aside.

Cook for another 20 seconds or so, and then add the blanched vegetables.

Stir-fry the vegetables for 1 minute. Then add the Shaoxing wine around the perimeter of the wok, followed by the sauce mixture. Cook for 30 seconds, until the sauce is at a simmer. Stir your cornstarch and water mixture, making sure the cornstarch hasn’t settled and add it to the wok.

Stir-fry for another 20-30 seconds until the sauce coats the vegetables.

And serve!
I love lotus！
